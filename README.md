## Scope and Experience Level

This project is developed as a beginner-to-intermediate hobbyist exercise inspired by how instructors structure and evaluate systems-oriented coursework.

While it borrows concepts commonly discussed in academic or professional settings (such as deterministic execution and state persistence), the implementation is intentionally modest in scale and complexity.

The goal is learning through structure rather than demonstrating advanced algorithms, optimization techniques, or production-level completeness. The design favors clarity, explicitness, and correctness over depth or breadth of features.
