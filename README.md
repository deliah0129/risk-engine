## Scope

This project is deliberately narrow.

It focuses on defining a clear execution flow, enforcing phase order, and persisting state in a way that makes system behavior observable and repeatable. Many features that could add depth or variety are intentionally omitted so the underlying mechanics remain explicit.

The result is a small, self-contained slice of a larger system, built to explore structure, constraints, and execution rather than completeness.
