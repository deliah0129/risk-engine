Scope (Playable Slice v0.1)

This project implements a deterministic, phase-based strategy simulation focused on execution order, persisted state, and governance-style constraints. The current scope is limited to core session setup, actor definition, and controlled state transitions across explicitly ordered phases. Systems such as combat resolution, economics, diplomacy, AI behavior, UI, and optimization are intentionally excluded at this stage.

The goal of this slice is not feature completeness, but structural clarity. Given the same inputs and phase sequence, the system produces the same outcomes, enabling inspection, reasoning, and validation of system behavior over time.
