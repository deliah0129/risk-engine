# RISK: Global Power (Design-Only, Deterministic by Construction)

This repo is a design-first simulation project focused on modeling how governments acquire, maintain, and lose power under internal and external pressures.

## The 60-second experience (first impressions count)
This project intentionally includes a **structure-only preflight** to demonstrate:
- deterministic outputs
- governance discipline (PACE)
- clean artifact generation (state + logs)

It does **not** run gameplay, scenarios, turns, actors, or mechanics yet.

### Run preflight
```bash
python -m risk_gp.preflight
