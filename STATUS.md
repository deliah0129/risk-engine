# Project Status

## Overview
This repository contains an active systems and research-oriented exploration of a deterministic strategy simulation engine.

The project is intentionally shared in a public state to allow inspection, review, and evaluation of its structure, execution model, and design decisions.

## Current Maturity
- Core architecture: **Stable**
- Phase separation model: **Implemented**
- Deterministic execution: **Verified**
- APIs and interfaces: **Evolving**
- Gameplay features: **Incomplete by design**
- Research framing: **In progress**

## Intentional Constraints
This project prioritizes:
- Determinism over randomness
- Auditability over spectacle
- Explicit state transitions over implicit behavior
- Structural clarity over feature completeness

As a result, some elements that would be expected in a consumer-facing application (UI, polish, content breadth) are intentionally absent at this stage.

## Usage Expectations
This repository is suitable for:
- Code inspection
- Architectural review
- Determinism and reproducibility evaluation
- Academic or instructional discussion

This repository is **not yet intended** for:
- End-user gameplay
- Feature comparison with commercial games
- Performance benchmarking

## Ongoing Work
Development is active. Structural changes, refactors, and documentation updates may occur without notice.

Feedback focused on system design, determinism, and clarity of intent is welcome.
